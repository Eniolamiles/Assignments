  I'm Eniola miles, hail from Nigeria. I am oriented, a goal getter and hardworking. One thing I thing I know for sure about myself 
  <br> which make me stands out is my uniqueness. .
  <br>
I am a certified interior designer and been in the design industry for about 5 years now.

<p>
  My utmost aim in the tech industry is to try as much as possible to combine both tech and art together.

    My hobby I will say is playing football and also playing video games. I think that are the only activities I tend to do at my free time.
